# Learning-Data-Science-With-Project_Walk-Through

## Introduction   
This repository is inspired by Nathan George book, the Practical Data Science. 



### Motivation
 
This group of project is to help demistify the production process of real life data science projections in production



### Objectives:

Our Objective is to:

1. Gain experience on the various machiene learning processes
2. Explore the machine learning framework like pandas, numpy, APIs, etc.
3. Build, elavalute and under machine learning models
